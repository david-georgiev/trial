find an easy way to read from csv and try to find how to right back the data given by the user back , or do that at the end?
reaad file to dictionary
use dictionary if a string can take place between the ket (iteID)  and value(itemvalue)

find a pattern of possible item value  

1  check if the space gets close to 1.5 billion if so warn the user that he is low on space 
and suggest him to move an item to  the library that gives us the most 0000s at the end because 8billions ends on zerooooos(which is our aim so we can accept 
anything so we keep the requirements of the exercise)
if item +warehouse value ends on 9 zeros put here
elif >>              >>          8 zeros put here
and so on until
else                              putitem in another warehouse
but check if the item will create more 0s  and choose the one where the item will create the less


2  use recursive function for better time complexity

use dictionary if a string can take place between the ket (iteID)  and value(itemvalue)
